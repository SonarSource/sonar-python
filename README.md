## Building the project

### Fast/minimal build

**Prerequisites:**
- JDK 11
- Maven 3.0.0 or newer

The easiest way to build the Project is by running:

`mvn clean install -DskipTypeshed`


It builds only Java Maven modules, run tests, and install jar locally.
The Python interpreter is not required in that case.

### Full build

**Prerequisites:**
- JDK 11
- Maven 3.0.0 or newer
- Python 3.9 or newer
- [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - `pip install tox`
- Run `git submodule update --init` to retrieve [Typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed) as a Git submodule

All above should be available in PATH.

To execute full build just run:

`mvn clean install`

The full build executes [Typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed) serializer script. 
It generates protobuf messages for Typeshed symbols (for standard Python API) and our customs symbols 
(for Python libraries, e.g. [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/work-with-cdk-python.html)).
This helps in type inference and providing better rules.  

## How to contribute

### Configuration

First, please configure your IDE:
https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-developer-toolset.

### Rule annotation

Each new implemented rule should have `@Rule(key = "S0000")` annotation on the class level.
The number of the rule can be found here: https://sonarsource.github.io/rspec/#/rspec/?lang=python.
The key is usually automatically generated by a [rspec](https://github.com/SonarSource/rspec) repository GitHub action
and needs to be unique in the whole project.

### Expectations:
- Commit message should be prefixed with the ticket number.
- Working on separate branch and creating PR when it's finished.
- Clean coded, well tested solution, quality gate should pass.
- Fix all issues reported by [SonarQube Next](https://next.sonarqube.com/sonarqube/dashboard?id=org.sonarsource.python%3Apython) instance.
- 95% or more code coverage for new changes (if possible). It can be checked on CI build.

### Before push

Please check if all files have a license header.
If not, the `mvn install` will fail with `Some files do not have the expected license header` message.
To fix that please execute: `mvn license:format`.
