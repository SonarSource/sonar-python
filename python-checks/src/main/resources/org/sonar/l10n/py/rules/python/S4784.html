<p>This rule is deprecated; use {rule:python:S5852} instead.</p>
<p>Using regular expressions is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-16021">CVE-2017-16021</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-13863">CVE-2018-13863</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluating regular expressions against input strings is potentially an extremely CPU-intensive task. Specially crafted regular expressions such as
<code>(a+)+s</code> will take several seconds to evaluate the input string <code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabs</code>. The problem is that with
every additional <code>a</code> character added to the input, the time required to evaluate the regex doubles. However, the equivalent regular
expression, <code>a+s</code> (without grouping) is efficiently evaluated in milliseconds and scales linearly with the input size.</p>
<p>Evaluating such regular expressions opens the door to <a
href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS">Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)</a> attacks.
In the context of a web application, attackers can force the web server to spend all of its resources evaluating regular expressions thereby making
the service inaccessible to genuine users.</p>
<p>This rule flags any execution of a hardcoded regular expression which has at least 3 characters and at least two instances of any of the following
characters: <code>*+{</code>.</p>
<p>Example: <code>(a+)*</code></p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the executed regular expression is sensitive and a user can provide a string which will be analyzed by this regular expression. </li>
  <li> your regular expression engine performance decrease with specially crafted inputs and regular expressions. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Check whether your regular expression engine (the algorithm executing your regular expression) has any known vulnerabilities. Search for
vulnerability reports mentioning the one engine you’re are using.</p>
<p>Use if possible a library which is not vulnerable to Redos Attacks such as <a href="https://github.com/google/re2">Google Re2</a>.</p>
<p>Remember also that a ReDos attack is possible if a user-provided regular expression is executed. This rule won’t detect this kind of injection.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>Django</p>
<pre>
from django.core.validators import RegexValidator
from django.urls import re_path

RegexValidator('(a*)*b')  # Sensitive

def define_http_endpoint(view):
    re_path(r'^(a*)*b/$', view)  # Sensitive
</pre>
<p><code>re</code> module</p>
<pre>
import re
from re import compile, match, search, fullmatch, split, findall, finditer, sub, subn


input = 'input string'
replacement = 'replacement'

re.compile('(a*)*b')  # Sensitive
re.match('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
re.search('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
re.fullmatch('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
re.split('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
re.findall('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
re.finditer('(a*)*b',input)  # Sensitive
re.sub('(a*)*b', replacement, input)  # Sensitive
re.subn('(a*)*b', replacement, input)  # Sensitive
</pre>
<p><code>regex</code> module</p>
<pre>
import regex
from regex import compile, match, search, fullmatch, split, findall, finditer, sub, subn, subf, subfn, splititer

input = 'input string'
replacement = 'replacement'

regex.subf('(a*)*b', replacement, input)  # Sensitive
regex.subfn('(a*)*b', replacement, input)  # Sensitive
regex.splititer('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive

regex.compile('(a*)*b')  # Sensitive
regex.match('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
regex.search('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
regex.fullmatch('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
regex.split('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
regex.findall('(a*)*b', input)  # Sensitive
regex.finditer('(a*)*b',input)  # Sensitive
regex.sub('(a*)*b', replacement, input)  # Sensitive
regex.subn('(a*)*b', replacement, input)  # Sensitive
</pre>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Some corner-case regular expressions will not raise an issue even though they might be vulnerable. For example: <code>(a|aa)+</code>,
<code>(a|a?)+</code>.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to test your regular expression if it has the same pattern on both side of a "<code>|</code>".</p>
