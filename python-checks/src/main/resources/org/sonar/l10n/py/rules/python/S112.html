<p>This rule raises an issue when a generic exception (such as <code>Exception</code> or <code>BaseException</code>) is raised.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Raising instances of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception"><code>Exception</code></a> and <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException"><code>BaseException</code></a> will have a negative impact on any code trying
to catch these exceptions.</p>
<p>From a consumer perspective, it is generally a best practice to only catch exceptions you intend to handle. Other exceptions should ideally not be
caught and let to propagate up the stack trace so that they can be dealt with appropriately. When a generic exception is thrown, it forces consumers
to catch exceptions they do not intend to handle, which they then have to re-raise.</p>
<p>Besides, when working with a generic type of exception, the only way to distinguish between multiple exceptions is to check their message, which is
error-prone and difficult to maintain. Legitimate exceptions may be unintentionally silenced and errors may be hidden.</p>
<p>For instance, if an exception such as <code>SystemExit</code> is caught and not re-raised, it will prevent the program from stopping.</p>
<p>When raising an exception, it is therefore recommended to raising the most specific exception possible so that it can be handled intentionally by
consumers.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>To fix this issue, make sure to throw specific exceptions that are relevant to the context in which they arise. It is recommended to either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raise a specific <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">Built-in exception</a> when one matches. For example
  <code>TypeError</code> should be raised when the type of a parameter is not the one expected.</li>
  <li>Create a custom exception class deriving from <code>Exception</code> or one of its subclasses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
def check_value(value):
    if value &lt; 0:
        raise BaseException("Value cannot be negative") # Noncompliant: this will be difficult for consumers to handle
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
def check_value(value):
    if value &lt; 0:
        raise ValueError("Value cannot be negative") # Compliant
</pre>
