<p>Reserved environment variable names should not be overridden in Lambda functions</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>AWS Lambda reserves certain environment variable names for its internal operations and runtime management. These reserved variables, such as
'_HANDLER', '_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID', 'AWS_REGION', and others, are automatically set by the Lambda service and contain critical information about the
function’s execution context. When application code overrides these reserved environment variables by assigning new values to them, it can disrupt the
Lambda runtime’s ability to function correctly. The Lambda service relies on these variables to manage function execution, implement tracing, handle
authentication, and maintain proper communication with other AWS services.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Overriding reserved environment variables can lead to unpredictable Lambda function behavior, runtime failures, broken tracing and monitoring
capabilities, authentication issues with AWS services, and difficulty in debugging production problems. This can result in service outages and
degraded system reliability.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Avoid modifying any environment variable names that are reserved by AWS Lambda. Use custom environment variable names that do not conflict with AWS
Lambda’s reserved names. Always prefix your custom environment variables with a unique identifier or use descriptive names that clearly indicate they
are application-specific.</p>

<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
import os

def lambda_handler(event, context):
  os.environ['AWS_REGION'] = "us-west-2"  # Noncompliant: overriding AWS Lambda reserved environment variable
  return {"statusCode": 200}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
import os

def lambda_handler(event, context):
  os.environ['APP_REGION'] = "us-west-2" # Compliant: using custom environment variable names
  return {"statusCode": 200}
</pre>
