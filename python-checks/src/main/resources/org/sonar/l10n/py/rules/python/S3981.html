<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The length of a collection is always greater than or equal to zero. So testing that a length is greater than or equal to zero doesn’t make sense,
since the result is always <code>true</code>. Similarly testing that it is less than zero will always return <code>false</code>. Perhaps the intent
was to check the non-emptiness of the collection instead.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
mylist = []
if len(myList) &gt;= 0:  # Noncompliant
    pass

if len(myList) &lt; 0:  # Noncompliant
    pass
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
mylist = []
if len(myList) &gt;= 42:
    pass

if len(myList) == 0:
    pass
</pre>
