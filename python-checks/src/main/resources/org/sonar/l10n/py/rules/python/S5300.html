<p>This rule is deprecated, and will eventually be removed.</p>
<p>Sending emails is security-sensitive and can expose an application to a large range of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Information Exposure</strong></p>
<p>Emails often contain sensitive information which might be exposed to an attacker if he can add an arbitrary address to the recipient list.</p>
<p><strong>Spamming / Phishing</strong></p>
<p>Malicious user can abuse email based feature to send spam or phishing content.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Content Injection</strong></p>
<p>Emails can contain HTML and JavaScript code, thus they can be used for XSS attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Email Headers Injection</strong></p>
<p>Email fields such as <code>subject</code>, <code>to</code>, <code>cc</code>, <code>bcc</code>, <code>from</code> are set in email "headers".&nbsp;
Using unvalidated user input to set those fields&nbsp;might allow attackers to inject new line characters in headers to craft malformed SMTP requests.
Although modern libraries are filtering new line character by default, user data used in&nbsp;email "headers" should always be validated.</p>
<p>In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9801">CVE-2017-9801</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4803">CVE-2016-4803</a> </li>
</ul>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Unvalidated user input are used to set email headers. </li>
  <li> Email content contains data provided by users and it is not sanitized. </li>
  <li> Email recipient list or body are based on user inputs. </li>
</ul>
<p>You are at risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Use an email library which sanitizes headers (Flask-Mail or django.core.mail). </li>
  <li> Use html escape functions to sanitize every piece of data used to in the email body. </li>
  <li> Verify application logic to make sure that email base feature can not be abuse to:
    <ul>
      <li> Send arbitrary email for spamming or fishing </li>
      <li> Disclose sensitive email content </li>
    </ul>  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>smtplib</p>
<pre>
import smtplib

def send(from_email, to_email, msg):
  server = smtplib.SMTP('localhost', 1025)
  server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, msg) # Sensitive
</pre>
<p>Django</p>
<pre>
from django.core.mail import send_mail

def send(subject, msg, from_email, to_email):
  send_mail(subject, msg, from_email, [to_email]) # Sensitive
</pre>
<p>Flask-Mail</p>
<pre>
from flask import Flask
from flask_mail import Mail, Message

app = Flask(__name__)

def send(subject, msg, from_email, to_email):
    mail = Mail(app)
    msg = Message(subject, [to_email], body, sender=from_email)
    mail.send(msg) # Sensitive
</pre>
