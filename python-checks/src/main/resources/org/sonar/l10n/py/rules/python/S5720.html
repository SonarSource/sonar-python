<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Instance methods, i.e. methods not annotated with <code>@classmethod</code> or <code>@staticmethod</code>, are expected to have at least one
parameter. This parameter will reference the object instance on which the method is called. By convention, this first parameter is named "self".</p>
<p>Naming the "self" parameter differently is confusing. It might also indicate that the "self" parameter was forgotten, in which case calling the
method will most probably fail.</p>
<p>Note also that creating methods which are used as static methods without the <code>@staticmethod</code> decorator is a bad practice because calling
these methods on an instance will raise a <code>TypeError</code>. Either move the method out of the class or decorate it with
<code>@staticmethod</code>.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when the first parameter of an instance method is not called "self".</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
class MyClass:
    def send_request(request):  # Noncompliant. "self" was probably forgotten
        print("send_request")

class ClassWithStaticMethod:
    def static_method(param):  # Noncompliant
        print(param)
ClassWithStaticMethod().static_method(42)  # Method is available on the instance but calling it will raise a TypeError
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
class MyClass:
    def send_request(self, request):
        print("send_request")

class ClassWithStaticMethod:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method(param):
        print(param)
ClassWithStaticMethod().static_method(42)
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>This rule will also accept "cls" or "mcs" as first parameter’s name for metaclasses' methods.</p>
<p>No issue will be raised for methods called <code>__init_subclass__</code>, <code>__class_getitem__</code> or <code>__new__</code> as these methods'
first parameter is a class.</p>
<p>You can also disable issues on methods decorated with a specific decorator. Add these decorators to this rule’s "ignoreDecorators" parameter.</p>
<p>With "ignoredDecorators" set to "abstractmethod"</p>
<pre>
from abc import abstractmethod, ABC

class MyClass(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def method():  # No issue, even if it is better in this case to also decorate with @staticmethod
        pass
</pre>
