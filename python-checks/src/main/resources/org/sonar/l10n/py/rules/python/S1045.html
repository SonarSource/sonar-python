<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Exceptions handlers (<code>except:</code>) are evaluated in the order they are written. Once a match is found, the evaluation stops.</p>
<p>In some contexts an except block is dead code as it will never catch any exception:</p>
<ul>
  <li> If there is a handler for a base class followed by a handler for class derived from that base class, the second handler will never trigger: The
  handler for the base class will match the derived class, and will be the only executed handler. </li>
  <li> When multiple <code>except</code> statements try to catch the same exception class, only the first one will be executed. </li>
  <li> In python 3, <code>BaseException</code> is the parent of every exception class. When <code>BaseException</code> is caught and the same
  try-except block has a bare <code>except:</code> statement, i.e. an <code>except</code> with no expression, the bare except will never catch
  anything. </li>
</ul>
<p>This rule raises an issue when an <code>except</code> block catches every exception before a later <code>except</code> block could catch it.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
def foo():
    try:
        raise FloatingPointError()
    except (ArithmeticError, RuntimeError) as e:
        print(e)
    except FloatingPointError as e: # Noncompliant. FloatingPointError is a subclass of ArithmeticError
        print("Never executed")
    except OverflowError as e: # Noncompliant. OverflowError is a subclass of ArithmeticError
        print("Never executed")

    try:
        raise TypeError()
    except TypeError as e:
        print(e)
    except TypeError as e: # Noncompliant. Duplicate Except.
        print("Never executed")

    try:
        raise ValueError()
    except BaseException as e:
        print(e)
    except: # Noncompliant. This is equivalent to "except BaseException" block
        print("Never executed")
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
def foo():
    try:
        raise FloatingPointError()
    except FloatingPointError as e:
        print("Executed")
    except OverflowError as e:
        print("Executed")
    except (ArithmeticError, RuntimeError) as e:
        print(e)

    try:
        raise TypeError()
    except TypeError as e:
        print(e)

    try:
        raise ValueError()
    except BaseException as e:
        print(e)
</pre>
