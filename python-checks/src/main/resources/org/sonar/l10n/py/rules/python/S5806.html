<p>This rule raises an issue when the name of a local variable matches the name of a builtin.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Defining a variable with the same name as a built-in symbol will "shadow" it. That means that the builtin will no longer be accessible through its
original name, having locally been replaced by the variable.</p>
<p>Shadowing a builtin makes the code more difficult to read and maintain. It may also be a source of bugs as you can reference the builtin by
mistake.</p>
<p>It is sometimes acceptable to shadow a builtin to improve the readability of a public API or to support multiple versions of a library. In these
cases, benefits are greater than the maintainability cost. This should, however, be done with care.</p>
<p>It is generally not a good practice to shadow builtins with variables which are local to a function or method. These variables are not public and
can easily be renamed, thus reducing the confusion and making the code less error-prone.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
def a_function():
    int = 42  # Noncompliant; int is a builtin
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
def a_function():
    value = 42
</pre>
