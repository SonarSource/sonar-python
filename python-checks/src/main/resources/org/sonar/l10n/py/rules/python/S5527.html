<p>This vulnerability allows attackers to impersonate a trusted host.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides secure communication between systems over the internet by encrypting the data sent between them. In this
process, the role of hostname validation, combined with certificate validation, is to ensure that a system is indeed the one it claims to be, adding
an extra layer of trust and security.</p>
<p>When hostname validation is disabled, the client skips this critical check. This creates an opportunity for attackers to pose as a trusted entity
and intercept, manipulate, or steal the data being transmitted.</p>
<p>To do so, an attacker would obtain a valid certificate authenticating <code>example.com</code>, serve it using a different hostname, and the
application code would still accept it.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Establishing trust in a secure way is a non-trivial task. When you disable hostname validation, you are removing a key mechanism designed to build
this trust in internet communication, opening your system up to a number of potential threats.</p>
<h4>Identity spoofing</h4>
<p>If a system does not validate hostnames, it cannot confirm the identity of the other party involved in the communication. An attacker can exploit
this by creating a fake server and masquerading it as a legitimate one. For example, they might set up a server that looks like your bank’s server,
tricking your system into thinking it is communicating with the bank. This scenario, called identity spoofing, allows the attacker to collect any data
your system sends to them, potentially leading to significant data breaches.</p>
<h2>How to fix it in Python Standard Library</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<p>The following code contains examples of disabled hostname validation.</p>
<p>Certificate validation is not enabled by default when <code>_create_unverified_context</code> or <code>_create_stdlib_context</code> is used. It is
recommended to use <code>create_default_context</code> instead. This method creates secure contexts that will check server hostnames and verify
certificates (see {rule:python:S4830} for more information) by default.<br> If <code>create_default_context</code> cannot be used, then the
<code>check_hostname</code> property must be set to <code>True</code> on the <code>SSLContext</code>. Doing so also automatically enables certificate
verification for this context.</p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
import ssl

ctx1 = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx1.check_hostname = False  # Noncompliant

ctx2 = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)  # Noncompliant
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
import ssl

# By default, hostname verification is enabled
ctx1 = ssl.create_default_context()

ctx2 = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
ctx2.check_hostname = True
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>To fix the vulnerability of disabled hostname validation, it is strongly recommended to first re-enable the default validation and fix the root
cause: the validity of the certificate.</p>
<h4>Use valid certificates</h4>
<p>If a hostname validation failure prevents connecting to the target server, keep in mind that <strong>one system’s code should not work around
another system’s problems</strong>, as this creates unnecessary dependencies and can lead to reliability issues.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first solution is to change the remote host’s certificate to match its identity. If the remote host is not under your control,
consider replicating its service to a server whose certificate you can change yourself.</p>
<p>In case the contacted host is located on a development machine, and if there is no other choice, try following this solution:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create a self-signed certificate for that machine. </li>
  <li> Add this self-signed certificate to the system’s trust store. </li>
  <li> If the hostname is not <code>localhost</code>, add the hostname in the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. </li>
</ul>
<h2>How to fix it in OpenSSL</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<p>Currently, pyOpenSSL does not provide any public method to enable hostname verification. Therefore, it is recommended to use another SSL library.
The <code>ssl</code> module of the Python standard library can be a great replacement for several use cases.</p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="11" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
import socket
from OpenSSL import SSL

ctx = SSL.Context(SSL.TLSv1_2_METHOD)  # Noncompliant
ctx.set_verify(SSL.VERIFY_PEER)

conn = SSL.Connection(ctx, socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM))
conn.connect(("www.example.com", 443))
conn.send("GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n".encode())
result = conn.recv(1024)

conn.shutdown()
conn.close()
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="11" data-diff-type="compliant">
import ssl
import socket

# By default, hostname verification is enabled
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()

with socket.create_connection(("www.example.com", 443)) as sock:
    with ctx.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname="www.example.com") as conn:
        conn.send(f"GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n".encode())
        conn.recv(1024)
</pre>
