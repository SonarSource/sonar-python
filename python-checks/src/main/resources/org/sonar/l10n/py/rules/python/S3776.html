<p>This rule raises an issue when the code cognitive complexity of a function is above a certain threshold.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard it is to understand the control flow of a unit of code. Code with high cognitive complexity is hard
to read, understand, test, and modify.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, high cognitive complexity is a sign that the code should be refactored into smaller, easier-to-manage pieces.</p>
<h3>Which syntax in code does impact cognitive complexity score?</h3>
<p>Here are the core concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cognitive complexity is incremented each time the code breaks the normal linear reading flow.</strong>
    <br>
    This concerns, for example, loop structures, conditionals, catches, switches, jumps to labels, and conditions mixing multiple operators.</li>
  <li><strong>Each nesting level increases complexity.</strong>
    <br>
    During code reading, the deeper you go through nested layers, the harder it becomes to keep the context in mind.</li>
  <li><strong>Method calls are free</strong>
    <br>
    A well-picked method name is a summary of multiple lines of code. A reader can first explore a high-level view of what the code is performing then
    go deeper and deeper by looking at called functions content.
    <br>
    <em>Note:</em> This does not apply to recursive calls, those will increment cognitive score.</li>
</ul>
<p>The method of computation is fully detailed in the pdf linked in the resources.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Developers spend more time reading and understanding code than writing it. High cognitive complexity slows down changes and increases the cost of
maintenance.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Reducing cognitive complexity can be challenging.
  <br>
  Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Extract complex conditions in a new function.</strong>
    <br>
    Mixed operators in condition will increase complexity. Extracting the condition in a new function with an appropriate name will reduce cognitive
    load.</li>
  <li><strong>Break down large functions.</strong>
    <br>
    Large functions can be hard to understand and maintain. If a function is doing too many things, consider breaking it down into smaller, more
    manageable functions. Each function should have a single responsibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid deep nesting by returning early.</strong>
    <br>
    To avoid the nesting of conditions, process exceptional cases first and return early.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<p><strong>Extraction of a complex condition in a new function.</strong></p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p>The code is using a complex condition and has a cognitive cost of 5.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
def process_eligible_users(users):
    for user in users:             # +1 (for)
        if ((user.is_active and    # +1 (if) +1 (nested) +1 (multiple conditions)
            user.has_profile) or   # +1 (mixed operator)
            user.age &gt; 18 ):
            user.process()
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<p>Even if the cognitive complexity of the whole program did not change, it is easier for a reader to understand the code of the
<code>process_eligible_users</code> function, which now only has a cognitive cost of 3.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
def process_eligible_users(users):
    for user in users:             # +1 (for)
        if is_eligible_user(user): # +1 (if) +1 (nested)
            user.process()

def is_eligible_user(user):
    return ((user.is_active and user.has_profile) or user.age &gt; 18) # +1 (multiple conditions) +1 (mixed operators)
</pre>
<p><strong>Break down large functions.</strong></p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> The code is simplified here, to illustrate the purpose. Please imagine there is more happening in the process.
  <br></p>
<p>The bellow code has a cognitive complexity score of 8.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="3" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
def process_user(user):
    if user.is_active():             # +1 (if)
        if user.has_profile():       # +1 (if) +1 (nested)
            ... # process active user with profile
        else:                        # +1 (else)
            ... # process active user without profile
    else:                            # +1 (else)
        if user.has_profile():       # +1 (if) +1 (nested)
            ... # process inactive user with profile
        else:                        # +1 (else)
            ... # process inactive user without profile
</pre>
<p>This function could be refactored into smaller functions: The complexity is spread over multiple functions and the breaks in flow are no more
nested.
  <br>
  The <code>process_user</code> has now a complexity score of two.</p>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="3" data-diff-type="compliant">
def process_user(user):
    if user.is_active():             # +1 (if)
        process_active_user(user)
    else:                            # +1 (else)
        process_inactive_user(user)

def process_active_user(user):
    if user.has_profile():           # +1 (if) +1 (nested)
        ... # process active user with profile
    else:                            # +1 (else)
        ... # process active user without profile

def process_inactive_user(user):
    if user.has_profile():           # +1 (if) +1 (nested)
        ... # process inactive user with profile
    else:                            # +1 (else)
        ... # process inactive user without profile
</pre>
<p><strong>Avoid deep nesting by returning early.</strong></p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p>The below code has a cognitive complexity of 6.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="4" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
def calculate(data):
    if data is not None:  # +1 (if)
        total = 0
        for item in data: # +1 (for) +1 (nested)
            if item &gt; 0:  # +1 (if)  +2 (nested)
                total += item * 2
        return total
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<p>Checking for the edge case first flattens the <code>if</code> statements and reduces the cognitive complexity to 4.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="4" data-diff-type="compliant">
def calculate(data):
    if data is None:      # +1 (if)
        return None
    total = 0
    for item in data:     # +1 (for)
        if item &gt; 0:      # +1 (if) +1 (nested)
            total += item * 2
    return total
</pre>
