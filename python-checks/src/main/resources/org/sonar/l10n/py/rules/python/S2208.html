<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Importing every public name from a module using a wildcard (<code>from mymodule import *</code>) is a bad idea because:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It could lead to conflicts between names defined locally and the ones imported. </li>
  <li> It reduces code readability as developers will have a hard time knowing where names come from. </li>
  <li> It clutters the local namespace, which makes debugging more difficult. </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that imported names can change when you update your dependencies. A wildcard import that works today might be broken tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>No issue will be raised in <code>__init__.py</code> files. Wildcard imports are a common way of populating these modules.</p>
<p>No issue will be raised in modules doing only imports. Local modules are sometimes created as a proxy for third-party modules.</p>
<pre>
# file: mylibrary/pyplot.py
try:
    from guiqwt.pyplot import *  # Ok
except Exception:
    from matplotlib.pyplot import *  # Ok
</pre>
<p>Just keep in mind that wildcard imports might still create issues in these cases. It’s always better to import only what you need.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>There are two ways to avoid a wildcard import:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Replace it with <code>import mymodule</code> and access module members as <code>mymodule.myfunction</code>. If the module name is too long,
  alias it to a shorter name. Example: <code>import pandas as pd</code> </li>
  <li> List every imported name. If necessary import statements can be split on multiple lines using parentheses (preferred solution) or backslashes.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre>
from math import *  # Noncompliant
def exp(x):
    pass
print(exp(0))   # "None" will be printed
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre>
import math
def exp(x):
    pass
print(math.exp(0))   # "1.0" will be printed
</pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre>
from math import exp as m_exp
def exp(x):
    pass
print(m_exp(0))   # "1.0" will be printed
</pre>
