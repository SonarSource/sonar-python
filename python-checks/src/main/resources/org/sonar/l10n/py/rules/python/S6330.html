<p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a managed message queuing service for application-to-application (A2A) communication. Amazon SQS can store
messages encrypted as soon as they are received. In the case that adversaries gain physical access to the storage medium or otherwise leak a message
from the file system, for example through a vulnerability in the service, they are not able to access the data.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The queue contains sensitive data that could cause harm when leaked. </li>
  <li> There are compliance requirements for the service to store data encrypted. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s recommended to encrypt SQS queues that contain sensitive information. Encryption and decryption are handled transparently by SQS, so no
further modifications to the application are necessary.</p>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_sqs.CfnQueue.html">aws_cdk.aws_sqs.CfnQueue</a>:</p>
<pre>
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_sqs as sqs
)

class CfnQueueStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -&gt; None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)
        sqs.CfnQueue(
            self,
            "example",
            sqs_managed_sse_enabled=False # Sensitive, unencrypted
        )
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_sqs.CfnQueue.html">aws_cdk.aws_sqs.CfnQueue</a>:</p>
<pre>
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_sqs as sqs
)

class CfnQueueStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -&gt; None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)
        sqs.CfnQueue(
            self,
            "example",
            sqs_managed_sse_enabled=True
        )
