<p>This rule raises an issue when the same key is used multiple times when instantiating a dictionary literal.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>By definition, a dictionary cannot hold the same key multiple times. When instantiating a dictionary literal, if a key is repeated, only the last
occurrence of the key will be retained.</p>
<p>This can lead to errors and confusion, as it is not clear which value belongs to which key. This can be remedied by either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>replacing the duplicated key with the correct key to prevent bugs and errors from occurring later in the program.</li>
  <li>removing the duplicated key to make the code more concise and easier to maintain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
{"one": 1, "two": 2, "one": 3}  # Noncompliant: the key "one" is duplicated.

def func(a1, a2):
    {a1: 1, a2: 2, a1: 3}  # Noncompliant: the key a1 is duplicated.
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
{"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}

def func(a1, a2):
    {a1: 1, a2: 2}
</pre>
