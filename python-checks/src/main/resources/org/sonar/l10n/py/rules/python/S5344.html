<p>The improper storage of passwords poses a significant security risk to software applications. This vulnerability arises when passwords are stored
in plaintext or with a fast hashing algorithm. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker typically requires access to the stored passwords.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Attackers who would get access to the stored passwords could reuse them without further attacks or with little additional effort.<br> Obtaining the
plaintext passwords, they could then gain unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to various malicious activities.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Plaintext or weakly hashed password storage poses a significant security risk to software applications.</p>
<h4>Unauthorized Access</h4>
<p>When passwords are stored in plaintext or with weak hashing algorithms, an attacker who gains access to the password database can easily retrieve
and use the passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as unauthorized data access,
identity theft, or even financial fraud.</p>
<h4>Credential Reuse</h4>
<p>Many users tend to reuse passwords across multiple platforms. If an attacker obtains plaintext or weakly hashed passwords, they can potentially use
these credentials to gain unauthorized access to other accounts held by the same user. This can have far-reaching consequences, as sensitive personal
information or critical systems may be compromised.</p>
<h4>Regulatory Compliance</h4>
<p>Many industries and jurisdictions have specific regulations and standards to protect user data and ensure its confidentiality. Storing passwords in
plaintext or with weak hashing algorithms can lead to non-compliance with these regulations, potentially resulting in legal consequences, financial
penalties, and damage to the reputation of the software application and its developers.</p>

<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<h4>Select the correct Argon2 parameters</h4>
<p>In general, the default values of the Argon2 library are considered safe. If you need to change the parameters, you should note the following:</p>
<p>First, Argon2 comes in three forms: Argon2i, Argon2d and Argon2id. Argon2i is optimized for hashing passwords and uses data-independent memory
access. Argon2d is faster and uses data-dependent memory access, making it suitable for applications where there is no risk of side-channel
attacks.<br> Argon2id is a mixture of Argon2i and Argon2d and is recommended for most applications.</p>
<p>Argon2id has three different parameters that can be configured: the basic minimum memory size (m), the minimum number of iterations (t) and the
degree of parallelism (p).<br> The higher the values of m, t and p result in safer hashes, but come at the cost of higher resource usage. There exist
general recommendations that balance security and speed in an optimal way.</p>
<p>Hashes should be at least 32 bytes long and salts should be at least 16 bytes long.</p>
<p>Next, the recommended parameters for Argon2id are:</p>

<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<h4>Use secure password hashing algorithms</h4>
<p>In general, you should rely on an algorithm that has no known security vulnerabilities. The MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms should not be used.</p>
<p>Some algorithms, such as the SHA family functions, are considered strong for some use cases, but are too fast in computation and therefore
vulnerable to brute force attacks, especially with bruteforce-attack-oriented hardware.</p>
<p>To protect passwords, it is therefore important to choose modern, slow password-hashing algorithms. The following algorithms are, in order of
strength, the most secure password hashing algorithms to date:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Argon2 </li>
  <li> scrypt </li>
  <li> bcrypt </li>
  <li> PBKDF2 </li>
</ol>
<p>Argon2 should be the best choice, and others should be used when the previous one is not available. For systems that must use FIPS-140-certified
algorithms, PBKDF2 should be used.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, choose the strongest algorithm available. If the algorithm currently used by your system should be upgraded, OWASP documents
possible upgrade methods here: <a
href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#upgrading-legacy-hashes">Upgrading Legacy Hashes</a>.</p>
<h4>Select the correct Bcrypt parameters</h4>
<p>When bcrypt’s hashing function is used, it is important to select a round count that is high enough to make the function slow enough to prevent
brute force: More than 12 rounds.</p>
<p>For bcrypt’s key derivation function, the number of rounds should likewise be high enough to make the function slow enough to prevent brute force:
More than 4096 rounds <code>(2^12)</code>.<br> This number is not the same coefficient as the first one because it uses a different algorithm.</p>
<p>In the python bcrypt library, the default number of rounds is 12, which is a good default value.<br> For the <code>bcrypt.kdf</code> function, at
least 50 rounds should be set, and the <code>ignore_few_rounds</code> parameter should be avoided, as it allows fewer rounds.</p>
<h3>Pitfalls</h3>
<h4>Pre-hashing passwords</h4>
<p>As bcrypt has a maximum length input length of 72 bytes for most implementations, some developers may be tempted to pre-hash the password with a
stronger algorithm before hashing it with bcrypt.</p>
<p>Pre-hashing passwords with bcrypt is not recommended as it can lead to a specific range of issues. Using a strong salt and a high number of rounds
is enough to protect the password.</p>

<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>The following sections provide guidance on the usage of these secure password-hashing algorithms as provided by hashlib.</p>
<h4>Select the correct Scrypt parameters</h4>
<p>If scrypt must be used, the default values of scrypt are considered secure.</p>
<p>Like Argon2id, scrypt has three different parameters that can be configured. N is the CPU/memory cost parameter and must be a power of two. r is
the block size and p is the parallelization factor.</p>
<p>All three parameters affect the memory and CPU usage of the algorithm. Higher values of N, r and p result in safer hashes, but come at the cost of
higher resource usage.</p>
<p>For scrypt, OWASP recommends to have a hash length of at least 64 bytes, and to set N, p and r to the values of one of the following rows:</p>

<h4>Select the correct PBKDF2 parameters</h4>
<p>If PBKDF2 must be used, be aware that default values might not be considered secure.<br> Depending on the algorithm used, the number of iterations
should be adjusted to ensure that the derived key is secure. The following are the recommended number of iterations for PBKDF2:</p>
<ul>
  <li> PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1: 1,300,000 iterations </li>
  <li> PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256: 600,000 iterations </li>
  <li> PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512: 210,000 iterations </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 is recommended by NIST.<br> Iterations are also called "rounds" depending on the library used.</p>
<p>When recommended cost factors are too high in the context of the application or if the performance cost is unacceptable, a cost factor reduction
might be considered. In that case, it should not be chosen under 100,000.</p>

might be considered. In that case, it should not be chosen under 100,000.</p>
<h3>Pitfalls</h3>
<h4>Pre-hashing passwords</h4>
<p>As bcrypt has a maximum length input length of 72 bytes for most implementations, some developers may be tempted to pre-hash the password with a
stronger algorithm before hashing it with bcrypt.</p>
<p>Pre-hashing passwords with bcrypt is not recommended as it can lead to a specific range of issues. Using a strong salt and a high number of rounds
is enough to protect the password.</p>
<p>More information about this can be found here: <a
href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pre-hashing-passwords-with-bcrypt">Pre-hashing Passwords with
Bcrypt</a>.</p>
<h3>Going the extra mile</h3>
<h4>Pepper</h4>
<p>In a defense-in-depth security approach, <strong>peppering</strong> can also be used. This is a security technique where an external secret value
is added to a password before it is hashed.<br> This makes it more difficult for an attacker to crack the hashed passwords, as they would need to know
the secret value to generate the correct hash.<br> <a

<h2>How to fix it in Django</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<p>Django uses the first item in the <code>PASSWORD_HASHERS</code> list to store new passwords. In this example, SHA-1 is used, which is too fast to
store passwords.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="203" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
# settings.py
PASSWORD_HASHERS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.SHA1PasswordHasher',  # Noncompliant
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.CryptPasswordHasher',
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.Argon2PasswordHasher',
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.ScryptPasswordHasher',
]
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<p>This example requires <code>argon2-cffi</code> to be installed, which can be done using <code>pip install django[argon2]</code>.</p>
<pre data-diff-id="203" data-diff-type="compliant">
# settings.py
PASSWORD_HASHERS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.Argon2PasswordHasher',
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.ScryptPasswordHasher',
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BCryptSHA256PasswordHasher',
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher',
    'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2SHA1PasswordHasher',
]
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<h4>Use secure password hashing algorithms</h4>
<p>In general, you should rely on an algorithm that has no known security vulnerabilities. The MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms should not be used.</p>
<p>Some algorithms, such as the SHA family functions, are considered strong for some use cases, but are too fast in computation and therefore
vulnerable to brute force attacks, especially with bruteforce-attack-oriented hardware.</p>
<p>To protect passwords, it is therefore important to choose modern, slow password-hashing algorithms. The following algorithms are, in order of
strength, the most secure password hashing algorithms to date:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Argon2 </li>
  <li> scrypt </li>
  <li> bcrypt </li>
  <li> PBKDF2 </li>
</ol>
<p>Argon2 should be the best choice, and others should be used when the previous one is not available. For systems that must use FIPS-140-certified
algorithms, PBKDF2 should be used.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, choose the strongest algorithm available. If the algorithm currently used by your system should be upgraded, OWASP documents
possible upgrade methods here: <a
href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#upgrading-legacy-hashes">Upgrading Legacy Hashes</a>.</p>
<p>In the previous example, Argon2 is used as the default password hashing function by Django. Use the <code>PASSWORD_HASHERS</code> variable
carefuly. If there is a need to upgrade, use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/passwords/#password-upgrading">Django’s
password upgrade documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Going the extra mile</h3>
<h4>Tweaking password hashing parameters</h4>
<p>It is possible to change the parameters of the password hashing algorithm to make it more secure. For example, you can increase the number of
iterations or the length of the salt.<br> <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/passwords/">The Django documentation contains
more details about these parameters</a>.</p>
<h4>Preventing user enumeration attacks</h4>
<p>Django uses the first item in <code>PASSWORD_HASHERS</code> to store passwords, but uses every hashing algorithm in the
<code>PASSWORD_HASHERS</code> list to check passwords during user login. If a user password was not hashed using the first algorithm, then Django
upgrades the hashed password after a user logs in.</p>
<p>This process is convenient to keep users up to date, but is also vulnerable to enumeration. If an attacker wants to know whether an account exists,
they can attempt a login with that account. By tracking how long it took to get a response, they can know if an older hashing algorithm was used (so
the account exists) or the new hashing algorithm was used (the default is an account does not exist.)</p>
<p>To fix this, <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/passwords/#password-upgrading-without-requiring-a-login">the Django
documentation</a> defines how to upgrade passwords without needing to log in. In this case, a custom hasher has to be created that wraps the old
hash.</p>

<h4>Select the correct Bcrypt parameters</h4>
<p>When bcrypt’s hashing function is used, it is important to select a round count that is high enough to make the function slow enough to prevent
brute force: More than 12 rounds.</p>
<p>For bcrypt’s key derivation function, the number of rounds should likewise be high enough to make the function slow enough to prevent brute force:
More than 4096 rounds <code>(2^12)</code>.<br> This number is not the same coefficient as the first one because it uses a different algorithm.</p>
<h4>Select the correct Argon2 parameters</h4>
<p>In general, the default values of the Argon2 library are considered safe. If you need to change the parameters, you should note the following:</p>
<p>First, Argon2 comes in three forms: Argon2i, Argon2d and Argon2id. Argon2i is optimized for hashing passwords and uses data-independent memory
access. Argon2d is faster and uses data-dependent memory access, making it suitable for applications where there is no risk of side-channel
attacks.<br> Argon2id is a mixture of Argon2i and Argon2d and is recommended for most applications.</p>
<p>Argon2id has three different parameters that can be configured: the basic minimum memory size (m), the minimum number of iterations (t) and the
degree of parallelism (p).<br> The higher the values of m, t and p result in safer hashes, but come at the cost of higher resource usage. There exist
general recommendations that balance security and speed in an optimal way.</p>
<p>Hashes should be at least 32 bytes long and salts should be at least 16 bytes long.</p>
<p>Next, the recommended parameters for Argon2id are:</p>
