<p>This rule raises an issue when a function or method returns a value that contradicts its type hint.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Developers can use type hints to specify which type a function is expected to return. Doing so improves maintainability since it clarifies the
contract of the function, making it easier to use and understand.</p>
<p>When annotating a function with a specific type hint, it is expected that the returned value matches the type specified in the hint.</p>
<p>If the type hint specifies a class or a named type, then the value returned should be an instance of that class or type. If the type hint specifies
a structural type, then the value returned should have the same structure as the type hint.</p>
<p>In the following example, while <code>Bucket</code> does not directly inherit from <code>Iterable</code>, it does implement the
<code>Iterable</code> protocol thanks to its <code>__iter__</code> method and can therefore be used as a valid <code>Iterable</code> return type.</p>
<pre>
from collections.abc import Iterator, Iterable

class Bucket:  # Note: no base classes
    ...
    def __len__(self) -&gt; int: ...
    def __iter__(self) -&gt; Iterator[int]: ...


def collect() -&gt; Iterable: return Bucket()
</pre>
<p>Since type annotations are not enforced at runtime, returning a completely different type might not fail. It is however likely to be unintended and
will lead to maintainability issues, if not bugs.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<p>To fix this issue, make sure that the returned value of your function is compatible with its type hint.</p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
def hello() -&gt; str:
    return 42  # Noncompliant: Function's type hint asks for a string return value
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
def hello() -&gt; str:
    return "Hello"
</pre>
