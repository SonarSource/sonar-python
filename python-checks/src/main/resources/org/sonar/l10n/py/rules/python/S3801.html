<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Because it is dynamically typed, Python does not enforce a return type on a function. This means that different paths through a function can return
different types of values, which can be very confusing to the user and significantly harder to maintain.</p>
<p>In particular, it is consequently also possible to mix empty <code>return</code> statements (implicitly returning <code>None</code>) with some
returning an expression. This rule verifies that all the <code>return</code> statements from a function are consistent.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
def foo(a): # Noncompliant, function will return "true" or None
  if a == 1:
    return True
  return
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
def foo(a):
  if a == 1:
    return True
  return False
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
def foo(a):
  if a == 1:
    return True
  return None
</pre>
