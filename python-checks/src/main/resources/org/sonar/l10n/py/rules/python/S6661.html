<p>This rule raises an issue when a lambda is directly assigned to a variable.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Assigning a lambda to a variable is not inherently wrong or discouraged in Python. Lambdas are anonymous functions that can be useful for short and
simple expressions or as function arguments. However, there are a few reasons why you might consider alternatives to assigning a lambda to a
variable:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Readability and clarity:</strong> Lambdas can be concise, but they may become less readable as the expression or logic becomes more
  complex. For more complex or longer functions, using a regular named function defined with def can make the code more readable and
  self-explanatory.</li>
  <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Lambdas are often used for one-off or small, isolated tasks. If you find that you need to reuse a piece of
  functionality in multiple places within your code or across modules, it is better to define a named function using def. This promotes code
  modularity and maintainability.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Lambdas do not support docstrings, which are important for providing clear and comprehensive documentation for
  your functions. If you need to document the purpose, parameters, or behavior of a function, it is best to define a named function using def and
  include a docstring.</li>
  <li><strong>Debugging and error handling:</strong> Lambdas are anonymous functions, which means that when an error occurs during execution, the
  traceback will not provide a specific name associated with the lambda function. This can make it more challenging to identify and troubleshoot
  errors. Named functions defined with def provide more meaningful tracebacks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using a def statements rather than assigning lambdas to variable is also recommended by <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/">PEP8</a>.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Use function definition using <code>def</code> statement instead of assigning lambda to a variable.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
def foo():
  multiply = lambda x, y: x * y # Noncompliant
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
def foo():
  def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
    ...
</pre>
