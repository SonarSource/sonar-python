<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Identity operators <code>is</code> and <code>is not</code> check if the same object is on both sides, i.e. <code>a is b</code> returns
<code>True</code> if <code>id(a) == id(b)</code>.</p>
<p>When a new object is created it will have its own identity. Thus if an object is created and used only in an identity check it is not possible for
the other operand to be the same object. The comparison is always <code>False</code> or always <code>True</code> depending on the operator used,
<code>is</code> or <code>is not</code>. To avoid this problem the identity operator could be replaced with an equality operator (== or !=), which will
use <code>__eq__</code> or <code>__ne__</code> methods under the hood.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when at least one operand of an identity operator is a new object which has been created just for this check, i.e.:</p>
<ul>
  <li> When it is a dict, list or set literal. </li>
  <li> When it is a call to <code>dict</code>, <code>set</code>, <code>list</code> or <code>complex</code> built-in functions. </li>
  <li> When such a new object is assigned to only one variable and this variable is used in an identity check. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
def func(param):
    param is {1: 2}  # Noncompliant; always False
    param is not {1, 2, 3}  # Noncompliant; always True
    param is [1, 2, 3]  # Noncompliant; always False

    param is dict(a=1)  # Noncompliant; always False

    mylist = []  # mylist is assigned a new object
    param is mylist  # Noncompliant; always False
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
def func(param):
    param == {1: 2}
    param != {1, 2, 3}
    param == [1, 2, 3]

    param == dict(a=1)

    mylist = []
    param == mylist
</pre>
