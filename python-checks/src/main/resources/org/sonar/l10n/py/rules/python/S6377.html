<p>XML signatures are a method used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of XML documents. However, if XML signatures are not validated securely,
it can lead to potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>XML can be used for a wide variety of purposes. Using a signature on an XML message generally indicates this message requires authenticity and
integrity. However, if the signature validation is not properly implemented this authenticity can not be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>By not enforcing secure validation, the XML Digital Signature API is more susceptible to attacks such as signature spoofing and injections.</p>
<h3>Increased Vulnerability to Signature Spoofing</h3>
<p>By disabling secure validation, the application becomes more susceptible to signature spoofing attacks. Attackers can potentially manipulate the
XML signature in a way that bypasses the validation process, allowing them to forge or tamper with the signature. This can lead to the acceptance of
invalid or maliciously modified signatures, compromising the integrity and authenticity of the XML documents.</p>
<h3>Risk of Injection Attacks</h3>
<p>Disabling secure validation can expose the application to injection attacks. Attackers can inject malicious code or entities into the XML document,
taking advantage of the weakened validation process. In some cases, it can also expose the application to denial-of-service attacks. Attackers can
exploit vulnerabilities in the validation process to cause excessive resource consumption or system crashes, leading to service unavailability or
disruption.</p>
<h2>How to fix it in SignXML</h2>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<p>The following noncompliant code example verifies an XML signature without providing a trusted signing authority. This code will accept any
signature created from a generally trusted certificate, for example, a Letâ€™s encrypt one.</p>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
from lxml import etree
from signxml import XMLVerifier

xml_file = open("signed.xml", "rb")
xml = etree.parse(xml_file)

XMLVerifier().verify(xml) # Noncompliant
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
from lxml import etree
from signxml import XMLVerifier

xml_file = open("signed.xml", "rb")
xml = etree.parse(xml_file)

cert_file = open("cert.pem", "rb")
cert = cert_file.read()
XMLVerifier().verify(xml, x509_cert=cert)
</pre>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>Here, the compliant solution provides a trusted certificate to the signature validation function. This will ensure only signatures computed with
the private key associated with the provided certificate will be accepted.</p>
