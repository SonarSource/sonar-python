<p>This rule raises an issue when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an <code>__exit__</code> method has a bare <code>raise</code> outside of an <code>except</code> block.</li>
  <li>an <code>__exit__</code> method raises the exception provided as parameter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Methods <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code> make it possible to implement objects which can be used as the expression of a
<code>with</code> statement:</p>
<pre>
with MyContextManager() as c :
    ... # do something with c
</pre>
<p>This statement can be rewritten as a <code>try...finally</code> and an explicit call to the <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code>
methods:</p>
<pre>
c = MyContextManager()
c.__enter__()
try:
    ... # do something with c
finally:
    c.__exit__()
</pre>
<p>The <code>__exit__</code> is the method of a statement context manager which is called when exiting the runtime context related to this object.</p>
<p>If an exception is supplied as an argument, its propagation can be suppressed by having the method return a truthy value. Otherwise, the exception
will be processed normally upon exit from the method.</p>
<p>The special method <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__exit__%20special#object.__exit__"><code>__exit__</code></a> should only raise an
exception when it fails. It should never raise the provided exception, it is the caller’s responsibility. The <code>__exit__</code> method can filter
provided exceptions by simply returning True or False. Raising this exception will make the stack trace difficult to understand.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>To fix this issue, make sure to avoid raising the exception provided to an <code>__exit__</code> method.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        raise  # Noncompliant: __exit__ method has a bare raise outside of an except block.

class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        raise args[2]  # Noncompliant: __exit__() methods should not reraise the provided exception; this is the caller’s responsibility.

class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        raise exc_value # Noncompliant: __exit__() methods should not reraise the provided exception; this is the caller’s responsibility.
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self, stop_exceptions):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):

            ...
        except:
            raise  # No issue when raising another exception. The __exit__ method can fail and raise an exception

class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        pass # by default the function will return None, which is always False, and the exc_value will naturally raise.

class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self, stop_exceptions):
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        raise MemoryError("No more memory")  # This is ok too.
