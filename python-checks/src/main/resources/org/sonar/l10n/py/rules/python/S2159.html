<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>In some cases a comparison with operators <code>==</code>, or <code>!=</code> will always return True or always return False. When this happens,
the comparison and all its dependent code can simply be removed. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> comparing unrelated builtin types such as string and integer. </li>
  <li> comparing class instances which do not implement <code>__eq__</code> or <code>__ne__</code> to an object of a different type (builtin or from
  an unrelated class which also doesn’t implement <code>__eq__</code> or <code>__ne__</code>). </li>
</ul>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
foo = 1 == "1"  # Noncompliant. Always False.

foo = 1 != "1"  # Noncompliant. Always True.

class A:
    pass

myvar = A() == 1  # Noncompliant. Always False.
myvar = A() != 1  # Noncompliant. Always True.
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
foo = 1 == int("1")

foo = str(1) != "1"

class Eq:
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return True

myvar = Eq() == 1
myvar = 1 == Eq()
myvar = Eq() != 1  # Ok. "__ne__" calls "__eq__" by default
myvar = 1 != Eq()
</pre>
