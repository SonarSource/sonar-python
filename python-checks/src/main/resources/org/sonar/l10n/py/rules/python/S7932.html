<p>This rule raises an issue when <code>return</code>, <code>break</code>, or <code>continue</code> statements are used to exit a <code>finally</code>
block.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Using <code>return</code>, <code>break</code>, or <code>continue</code> statements that exit a <code>finally</code> block can lead to confusing
control flow and unexpected behavior. When these statements exit a <code>finally</code> block, they can mask exceptions that were raised in the
corresponding <code>try</code> or <code>except</code> blocks, making debugging difficult.</p>
<p>Starting with Python 3.14, this pattern emits a <code>SyntaxWarning</code> as specified in PEP 765, indicating that this usage is discouraged and
may become a syntax error in future Python versions. The <code>finally</code> block is intended for cleanup code that should always execute,
regardless of how the <code>try</code> block exits. When control flow statements exit the <code>finally</code> block, they can interfere with this
guarantee.</p>
<p>Additionally, this pattern can make code harder to understand and maintain, as the actual exit point becomes unclear when reading the code.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Using control flow statements that exit <code>finally</code> blocks can lead to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Debugging difficulties</strong>: The actual cause of issues may be hidden when exceptions are suppressed unexpectedly</li>
  <li><strong>Future compatibility issues</strong>: Code may break in future Python versions when this becomes a syntax error</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced code maintainability</strong>: Control flow becomes harder to follow and understand</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to fix?</h3>
<p>Move the return statement outside the finally block and use a variable to store the return value if needed.</p>
<h4>Non-compliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
def risky_function():
    try:
        do_something()
    finally:
        cleanup()
        return "done"  # Noncompliant
</pre>
<h4>Compliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
def safe_function():
    result = None
    try:
        do_something()
        result = "done"
    finally:
        cleanup()
    return result
</pre>
