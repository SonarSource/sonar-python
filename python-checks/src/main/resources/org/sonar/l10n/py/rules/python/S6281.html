<p>By default S3 buckets are private, it means that only the bucket owner can access it.</p>
<p>This access control can be relaxed with ACLs or policies.</p>
<p>To prevent permissive policies to be set on a S3 bucket the following booleans settings can be enabled:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>block_public_acls</code>: to block or not public ACLs to be set to the S3 bucket. </li>
  <li> <code>ignore_public_acls</code>: to consider or not existing public ACLs set to the S3 bucket. </li>
  <li> <code>block_public_policy</code>: to block or not public policies to be set to the S3 bucket. </li>
  <li> <code>restrict_public_buckets</code>: to restrict or not the access to the S3 endpoints of public policies to the principals within the bucket
  owner account. </li>
</ul>
<p>The other attribute <code>BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS</code> only turns on <code>block_public_acls</code> and <code>ignore_public_acls</code>. The
public policies can still affect the S3 bucket.</p>
<p>However, all of those options can be enabled by setting the <code>block_public_access</code> property of the S3 bucket to
<code>BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL</code>.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The S3 bucket stores sensitive data. </li>
  <li> The S3 bucket is not used to store static resources of websites (images, css …​). </li>
  <li> Many users have the permission to set ACL or policy to the S3 bucket. </li>
  <li> These settings are not already enforced to true at the account level. </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>It’s recommended to configure:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>block_public_acls</code> to <code>True</code> to block new attempts to set public ACLs. </li>
  <li> <code>ignore_public_acls</code> to <code>True</code> to block existing public ACLs. </li>
  <li> <code>block_public_policy</code> to <code>True</code> to block new attempts to set public policies. </li>
  <li> <code>restrict_public_buckets</code> to <code>True</code> to restrict existing public policies. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>By default, when not set, the <code>block_public_access</code> is fully deactivated (nothing is blocked):</p>
<pre>
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket"        # Sensitive
)
</pre>
<p>This <code>block_public_access</code> allows public ACL to be set:</p>
<pre>
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess(
        block_public_acls=False,       # Sensitive
        ignore_public_acls=True,
        block_public_policy=True,
        restrict_public_buckets=True
    )
)
</pre>
<p>The attribute <code>BLOCK_ACLS</code> only blocks and ignores public ACLs:</p>
<pre>
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS     # Sensitive
)
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>This <code>block_public_access</code> blocks public ACLs and policies, ignores existing public ACLs and restricts existing public policies:</p>
<pre>
bucket = s3.Bucket(self,
    "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL # Compliant
)
</pre>
<p>A similar configuration to the one above can obtained by setting all parameters of the <code>block_public_access</code></p>
<pre>
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "bucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess(       # Compliant
        block_public_acls=True,
        ignore_public_acls=True,
        block_public_policy=True,
        restrict_public_buckets=True
    )
)
</pre>
