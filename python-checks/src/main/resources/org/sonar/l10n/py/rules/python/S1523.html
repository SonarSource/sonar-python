<p>Executing code dynamically is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9807">CVE-2017-9807</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9802">CVE-2017-9802</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9182">CVE-2016-9182</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000210">CVE-2018-1000210</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>It is dangerous to let external sources either:</p>
<ul>
  <li> execute unknown code in your process. Such <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Injection">Injected Code</a> can either run on the
  server or in the client (exemple: XSS attack). </li>
  <li> select the code which will be executed via reflection. </li>
</ul>
<p>This rule marks for review each occurence of such dynamic code execution. The goal is to guide security code reviews.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the executed code may come from a untrusted source and hasn't been sanitized. </li>
  <li> the code to run is dynamically chosen via reflection, and an untrusted source can use it to choose which code to run. For example a class could
  be retrieved by its name and this name comes from a user input. </li>
</ul>
<p>You are at risk if you answered yes to any of these questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<p>Regarding the execution of unknown code, the best solution is to not run code provided by an untrusted source. If you really need to do it, run the
code in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandboxed</a> environment. Use jails, firewalls and whatever means your
operating system and programming language provide (example: <a
href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEC54-J.+Create+a+secure+sandbox+using+a+security+manager">Security Managers</a> in java, <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp">iframes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">same-origin
policy</a> for javascript in a web browser).</p>
<p>Do not try to create a blacklist of dangerous code. It is impossible to cover all attacks that way.</p>
<p>As for the use of reflection, it should be strictly controlled as it can lead to many vulnerabilities. Never let an untrusted source decide what
code to run. If you have to do it anyway, create a list of allowed code and choose among this list.</p>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>Calling reflection methods with a hard-coded type name, method name or field name will not raise an issue.</p>

<h2>Questionable Code Example</h2>
<pre>
import os

value = input()
hardcoded_command = 'os.system("ls")'
formatted_command = 'os.system("%s")' % value
compiled_command = compile(hardcoded_command, '&lt;string&gt;', 'eval')
compiled_code = compile(hardcoded_command, '&lt;string&gt;', 'exec')

def evaluate(command, file, mode):
    eval(command)  # Questionable. Dynamic command
    eval(compile(command, file, mode))  # Questionable. Dynamic command

eval(hardcoded_command)  # Ok
eval(formatted_command)  # Questionable. Dynamic code
eval(compiled_command)  # Questionable even though it is hardcoded, but only because it is not worth detecting this corner case.

def execute(code, file, mode):
    exec(code)  # Questionable. Dynamic code
    exec(compile(code, file, mode))  # Questionable. Dynamic command

exec(hardcoded_command)  # Ok
exec(formatted_command)  # Questionable. Dynamic code
exec(compiled_code)  # Questionable even though it is hardcoded, but only because it is not worth detecting this corner case.
